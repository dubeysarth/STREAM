# STREAM
Repository accompanying the manuscript titled "STREAM: Standardizing Data Curation and Failure Diagnosis from Lumped to Distributed Rainfall–Runoff Modeling" (KDD 2026)

The codes to generate the data inventory are included in this GitHub Repo.

Sample of curated dataset, along with the assets accompanying experiments and analysis are available at Zenodo (10.5281/zenodo.18559271)
